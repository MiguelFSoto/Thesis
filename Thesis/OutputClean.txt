if they endorse it i cant trust it how outgroup leader endorsements undercut public support for civil war peace settlements nicholas haas new york university prabin b khadka new york university abstract civil wars are a greater source of violence than any other type of conflict yet little is known about one of the key determinants of civil war peace settlement success civilian support we evaluate how a core component of nearly all peace settlements leader endorsements affects public support we predict that individuals in conflict settings will view settlements endorsed by outgroup leaders as less trustworthy and that they will become less supportive we conduct an endorsement experiment with nearly respondents in south sudan in taking advantage of a brief cessation in a devastating civil war public support for a tentative settlement drops precipitously when it is endorsed by an outgroup leader but does not increase when it is endorsed by an ingroup leader we find suggestive evidence that effects are strongest for individuals with the greatest reason to fear outgroup leaders those whose communities were targeted most violently by that outgroup verification

settlements to durably end civil conflicts have identified two key determinants0 first settlement content matters the presence of provi sions that solve commitment problems for warring par ties or the ability of one group to credibly commit to the other that it will not renege on settlement terms once in power fearon increases the likelihood of durable peace second settlement implementation can be a pow erful predictor of settlement success hartzell and hoddie joshi and quinn implementation of useful provisions like those that solve commitment problems can have significant positive direct effects implementa tion can also serve as a costly signal of a commitment to longterm peace by groups in power hartzell and hoddie joshi and quinn in this article we investigate how leader endorse ments shape public opinion toward peace settlements during ongoing conflicts there is abundant evi dence that public opinion affects the two primary drivers of settlement success settlement content and implementation but until recently civilian attitudes have not attracted significant scholarly attention garbirasdiaz garciasanchez and matanock matanock and garciasanchez civilians most clearly

for peace settlements the settlement itself is subject to referendum but public opinion can also shape settlement negotiations and implementation when no referenda are held or when a settlement has already been approved with important implications for settlement success nilsson0000 recent civilianled protests in sudan resulted both in changes in leadership and the terms of transition until planned democratic elections associated press leaders of ten use unfavorable public opinion polls and the threat of referenda to gain leverage in peace deal negotiations and to put constraints on possible settlement content for in stance israel in passed a law requiring a referendum to approve any peace deal in which territory was ceded the referendum requirement was widely interpreted as an effort to take landforpeace deals off the negotiating table as most surveys showed a majority of citizens opposing such terms kershner peace deals that are passed without widespread civilian support or involve ment or for which support wanes following their passage risk falling short of full implementation as constituents are less likely to hold politicians accountable for reneging on settlement terms they do not support or view as legitimate and may even pressure them to do so nilsson although colombias congress ultimately passed a peace deal in november bypassing a second ref erendum after the first settlement proposal was narrowly rejected by voters in october its implementation has lagged in core areas and significant uncertainty looms casey kew and john find that indirect and direct civil society participation in peace negotia tions are associated with greater durability of negotiated peace we experimentally evaluate how endorsements from real leaders of two parties engaged in an ethnic civil war in south sudan affect civilian support for a tentative peace settlement we specifically focus on how leader endorse ments affect public opinion of a peace settlement for three key reasons first we study an aspect of an ongoing set tlement process with relevance to a large number of cases endorsements by parties pursuant to the agreement ac company nearly all peace settlements parties typically endorse the settlement not only through their signatures but also through written statements and spoken words at signing ceremonies second there is good reason to expect that endorsements are especially impactful in low information conflict settings and concerning complicated peace provisions research shows that uninformed citi zens often use political endorsements as a cognitive short although implementation in colombia has advanced in some areas the kroc institute found that over twothirds of stip ulations had either been minimally implemented or not initiated at all cut to decide which candidate or policy to support and thus to act as if they were informed arceneaux and kolodny broockman and butler garbiras diaz garciasanchez and matanock lupia minozzi et al further citizens are likely to have strong feelings about different leaders to whom they may alternatively attribute violent actions heroic resistance or gross incompetence third endorsements of settlements are of theoretical interest scholars have found that con flict can change individuals priorities and emotions but we lack knowledge regarding how these changes might interact with individuals interpretations of leader en dorsements of peace settlements the extant literature indicates that effects of leader endorsements of complex peace provisions should differ depending on a respondents perception of the endorser individuals have been found to respond differently to cues from sources they trust and whom they see as shar ing common interests values and an identity as com pared with sources who do not have these characteristics arceneaux and kolodny coan et al lupia in the context we study where individuals were targeted for violence based on ethnic markers center for civilians in conflict the ethnic identity of leaders is likely to condition how individuals respond to their endorsements however although the literature points us toward considering whether a leader and respondent share an ethnic identity it does not offer clear predic tions as to how endorsements should operate in conflict settings we thus draw on the literature to propose two hypotheses but note that ex ante effects from in and outgroup leaders could plausibly shift support in multi ple directions a number of studies have found that endorsements from ingroup political elites tend to increase support for a policy particularly over complex issues brader and tucker coan et al garbirasdiaz garcia sanchez and matanock minozzi et al vi olence can tighten group boundaries and lead to greater ingroup cohesion and coethnic support hadzic carlson and tavits rohner thoenig and zilibotti if individuals blame outgroup leaders for the continuation of violence and believe that their ingroup leaders are rep resenting their interests the best they can under difficult circumstances then we should expect ingroup endorse ments to have a positive effect on support for peace set tlements our ingroup hypothesis draws on these stud ies to propose that individuals should be more likely to support peace settlement terms endorsed by ingroup po litical elites however there is reason to question the applicabil ity of these findings to the conflict setting we study in this content downloaded from on fri mar all use subject to nicholas haas and prabin b khadka contexts such as south sudan where both sides have been repeatedly blamed for relapses in violence and bro ken peace deals ingroup leaders may not emerge com pletely unscathed in the eyes of their coethnics de juan and pierskalla de vries and schomerus lyall blair and imai if people begin to question the ability of ingroup leaders to deliver peace then a non credible but nonthreatening ingroup endorsement may not convey new information about the costs and bene fits of the policy and may not lead individuals to update their level of support in other contexts that feature high intergroup polarization and outgroup distrust scholars have found that outgroup endorsements conveyed more information than did ingroup endorsements which had no or very little effect on policy preferences arceneaux and kolodny lupia nicholson finally an ingroup endorsement could decrease support if in dividuals begin to question their leaders intentions and interests expectations regarding the effects of outgroup lead ers endorsements are similarly mixed scholars have found that elites can be persuasive among the general pop ulation and even with outgroup constituents broock man and butler minozzi et al if people feel that outgroup leaders will represent them and their inter ests well then outgroup leader endorsements could lead to increases in support where outgroup leaders are not viewed as having expertise or as being threatening their endorsements may have little effect on support a third possibility that has found support in other contexts is that outgroup leader endorsements will lead to decreases in support arceneaux and kolodny lupia lyall blair and imai matanock and garbirasdiaz nicholson outgroup endorsements may es pecially decrease support in conflict settings first con flict can make individuals more distrustful of outgroup leaders and individuals beber roessler and scacco flail et al hetherington and suhay second studies have found that conflict and threat may lead indi viduals to put a greater priority on security as opposed to other considerations such as equality democracy or the uncertain future that a peace deal promises berrebi and klor huddy and feldman phayal our outgroup hypothesis posits that individuals should be less likely to support a peace deal endorsed by outgroup political elites to evaluate these competing hypotheses we con ducted an endorsement experiment with a diverse ar ray of nearly respondents in south sudan in early when there was a brief lull in civil war violence between the ethnically dinkaassociated sudan peoples liberation movement splm led by the incumbent president salva kiir and the ethnically nuerassociated splmin opposition splmio led by ousted vice president riek machar participants were randomly as signed to receive policy questions with no endorsement or with an endorsement by a political actor of inter est either splmkiir or splmiomachar we estimate the effects of in and outgroup leader endorsements on support by considering dinka and nuer respondents n = we supplement these results with analyses of two minority ethnic groups the shilluk n = and luo n = that had vastly different wartime experiences we find support for the outgroup hypothesis but not the ingroup hypothesis for both dinka and nuer sub jects support drops significantly for peace deals when they are endorsed by an ethnic outgroup leader but it does not change significantly following the endorse ment of an ingroup leader we find suggestive evidence that the negative effect of an outgroup endorsement is strongest for individuals whose communities were tar geted most violently by that outgroup there is inconsis tent evidence that the outgroup effect is moderated by the effect of being displaced among nuer respondents where a group shilluk respondents has been targeted by one side in the dispute an endorsement from that sides leader decreases support for the peace deal but en dorsements from leaders who have not targeted the group do not significantly alter support where a group luo respondents has faced similar levels of violence from both leaders endorsements do not significantly change support our study makes a number of contributions to the extant literature first it advances a nascent literature on public opinion toward peace deals and the role that leaders endorsements play in swaying views garbiras diaz garciasanchez and matanock matanock and garbirasdiaz matanock and garciasanchez second it elucidates how conflict may affect in dividuals responses to endorsements in particular ways third we take a different tack from much excellent previ ous work on ethnic conflict focusing on the determinants of support for policies that may result in peace rather than on how candidate selection can contribute to or alterna tively damage prospects for peace0 fourth we extend research on how conflict and fear affect attitudes and preferences to consider how they can shape views toward peace deals 0an extensive literature considers under what conditions individ uals support ethnic candidates or political parties eg chandra this content downloaded from on fri mar all use subject to public support for peace settlements theory and hypotheses how should we expect citizens to respond to leaders endorsements of peace settlements an extensive liter ature has found that citizens often utilize political en dorsements as information shortcuts or heuristics to make decisions about a wide range of outcomes includ ing preferred policies and candidates arceneaux and kolodny broockman and butler garbiras diaz garciasanchez and matanock lupia minozzi et al these heuristics allow citizens to reduce the costs of making complex decisions that would otherwise be cognitively taxing both in terms of effort in formation collection and capacity processing chaiken liberman and eagly political endorsements from trusted and familiar sources indicate that the policy or candidate under consideration is good and would advance the respondents interests endorsements from distrusted sources may indicate the opposite through adopting in formational shortcuts uninformed citizens may cheaply emulate the behavior of more knowledgeable individuals lupia scholars have often found that individuals respond differently to endorsements from elites with a shared identity however the literature does not provide clear predictions as to how endorsements of peace settlements from in and outgroup leaders should affect public sup port in conflict settings see table a00 in the supporting information si in what follows we review the litera tures on in and outgroup endorsement effects and derive two hypotheses for how they might operate in conflict settings ingroup endorsements a number of studies have found that ingroup endorse ments can significantly increase support for policies and candidates brader and tucker coan et al garbirasdiaz garciasanchez and matanock mi nozzi et al coan et al conduct a lab exper iment in the united states in which they randomly assign subjects to receive endorsements from either the repub lican party one of two smaller parties green or reform or no party on issues ranging from abortion least com plex or new to class action lawsuits most difficult and unexplored they find that individuals are significantly more likely to adopt the issue positions of parties with a number of studies do not disentangle whether movement toward an ingroup elites position was driven by an ingroup endorsement an outgroup endorsement or both si table a00 which they are familiar and trust and where the issue area is complex brader and tucker conduct party cue endorsement experiments with subjects from three countries britain hungary and poland they find that ingroup endorsements increase support and that effects are stronger in countries with more established party sys tems where partisanship is a salient identity and parties have established clear reputations to our knowledge garbirasdiaz garciasanchez and matanock and matanock and garbirasdiaz present the only other experimental evidence on peace policy endorsements in colombia where there was an extended civil war between the government and a rebel group farc whereas the former study includes endorsements from two government officiais and dis tinguishes between ingroups and outgroups on the ba sis of stated affinity with each leader the latter study only includes endorsements from farc which due to its widespread unpopularity the authors treat as an outgroup for all respondents garbirasdiaz garcia sanchez and matanock find that an endorsement from one politician former president uribe significantly increases support among affiliating respondents but they do not find parallel results for the other president san tos research has shown that outgroup violence can lead individuals to support an ingroup but that ingroup vio lence does not result in outgroup gains this home team discount suggests that ingroup leaders may largely avoid blame despite the continuation of violence lyall blair and imai if people blame the outgroup for violence but not the ingroup and if conflict increases eth nic identification and coethnic support hadzic carlson and tavits rohner thoenig and zilibotti then positive ingroup endorsement effects may even be greater in conflict settings ingroup hypothesis individuals should be more likely to support peace settlement terms that are endorsed by ingroup political elites endorsements from outgroup po litical elites may increase decrease or not have an effect on support there are a number of reasons why ingroup en dorsements may not generate increases in support for peace provisions in conflict settings in nonconflict set tings characterized by intergroup polarization or higher outgroup distrust than ingroup trust two features we expect to be strongly present in many conflict settings as we discuss below scholars have found that ingroup endorsements have little to no effect on support for poli cies possibly because they convey less information than outgroup endorsements arceneaux and kolodny lupia nicholson additionally in conflict this content downloaded from on fri mar all use subject to nicholas haas and prabin b khadka settings blame for persistent violence may permeate in dividuals perceptions of ingroup leaders whose contin ued failures to deliver peace could make their subsequent promises to do so seem noncredible if ingroup endorse ments appear both noncredible and nonthreatening then they may not convey new information about costs and benefits of a policy or lead individuals to update their level of support de juan and pierskalla ar gue that the failure of a group to protect its supporters communicates low competence in south sudan there is evidence that civilians do not view as credible calls for peace from either side de vries and schomerus we believe that this theory could be consistent with at least two possible interpretations of results from garbiras diaz garciasanchez and matanock first the authors find that an ingroup endorsement in from uribe who was last president in increased sup port but that an ingroup endorsement from president santos who served until did not these asymmet ric results may be explained by individuals attributing greater blame for failures to the ingroup leader currently in power santos but not to an expresident uribe sec ond as matanock and garbirasdiaz show in the colombian context farc was very unpopular with the vast majority of citizens where everyone agrees that one group is responsible for violence alternative elites in this case both santos and uribe may to a large degree es cape blame for violence the findings from matanock and garbirasdiaz thus suggest possible bounds on the theory proposed above first for individuals to attribute blame to ingroup leaders those leaders should be seen as recently making decisions that impacted the peace process second there must be some uncertainty over who is responsible for violence in settings such as colombia where a guerrilla group waged an insurgent campaign against the government individuals on one side the government may largely avoid blame0 finally an ingroup endorsement could decrease sup port if blame for continued violence leads individuals to doubt both in and outgroup leaders intentions if an in group leader is seen as advancing interests contrary to ones own then just as with an outgroup leader their en dorsement of a policy may signal that it is costly although lyall blair and imai find that people respond asymmetrically to violence perpetrated by ingroups and outgroups they still find that in the aggregate neither side is popular in a number of regions endorsements from both sides decrease support for policies which the au similarly people may attribute an outgroup responsibility for vi olence where the group is seen as a foreign occupying force as in the context of lyall blair and imais study thors attribute to a backdrop of war weariness in which neither combatant is especially favored outgroup endorsements as with ingroup endorsements the literature indicates that outgroup endorsements in conflict settings could shift support of peace provisions in multiple direc tions scholars have found that politicians endorsements can shift policy support in the intended direction with the general population including outgroup constituents minozzi et al show that copartisans and other constituents find their us members of congress sim ilarly persuasive broockman and butler do not observe that democratic state legislators are less persua sive with constituents who do not approve of democratic president barack obama if a belief that national politi cians represent everyones interests is sufficient to override salient identity divisions then outgroup leader endorse ments could result in increases in policy support out group leader endorsements could also result in little to no shift in policy preferences if outgroup leaders are seen as having different interests but are not viewed as partic ularly credible or threatening or where they do not have an established reputation a third possibility is that outgroup leader endorse ments in conflict settings will signal that a policy is costly and will decrease support even in nonconflict settings endorsements from distrusted outgroup lead ers have been found to result in substantial decreases in support for policies arceneaux and kolodny lupia nicholson we posit that negative outgroup effects are likely to be even stronger in conflict settings for two reasons first conflict is likely to reduce trust in outgroup leaders and individuals individuals with greater threat perception and who have been targeted for violence are more intolerant are less trusting and seek more punitive measures against outgroups beber roessler and scacco hall et al hethering ton and suhay blair et al attribute lower support for militant groups among the urban poor to that groups greater exposure to terrorist violence and its negative externalities lyall blair and imai sim ilarly find that victimization from an outgroup leads to a drop in support for that group these studies suggest that individuals in conflict settings will be less trusting of outgroup leaders and more fearful that an outgroup endorsement of a policy indicates that the leader sees an opportunity for further exploitation second individuals in conflict settings may become more likely to prioritize security above other concerns this content downloaded from on fri mar all use subject to public support for peace settlements people who perceive a greater threat have been found to favor aggressive foreign policy hetherington and suhay huddy and feldman and to be more willing to exchange personal liberties for security and for leaders who are punitive conservative or nationalist berrebi and klor phayal in sum we propose that conflict may significantly reduce individuals trust in outgroup leaders and shift their priorities toward security these changes lead us to expect that individuals should be less likely to support peace settlement terms that are endorsed by outgroup leaders where individuals central concern is security and where the central threat to that security comes from heavily distrusted outgroup leaders an out group endorsement of peace terms vulnerable to exploita tion may draw particular attention from respondents and reduce their support outgroup hypothesis individuals should be less likely to support a peace deal when it is endorsed by outgroup political elites effects should be strongest for those who perceive the most threat from the outgroup endorse ments from ingroup political elites may increase decrease or not have an effect on support divergent findings in garbirasdiaz garcia sanchez and matanock and matanock and garbirasdiaz in colombia may highlight how endorsements from outgroups that have engaged in vi olence are perceived as particularly negative signals of a policys merits when the outgroup elite is a politician one holds in low esteem but who has not violently targeted supporters of the alternative elite his endorsement does not result in decreases in support for peace provisions garbirasdiaz garciasanchez and matanock in contrast when the outgroup is a rebel group that en gaged in guerrilla warfare their endorsement results in a significant drop in support for provisions matanock and garbirasdiaz we posit that exposure to violence may moderate a negative outgroup endorsement effect exposure to vi olence has been shown to increase fear and distrust of and lower support for outgroups beber roessler and scacco blair et al grossman manekin and miodownik hadzic carlson and tavits de juan and pierskalla find that those exposed to greater violence have less trust in leaders who failed to protect them berrebi and klor argue that israeli voters become more supportive of farright polit ical parties following terror attacks because those parties place more weight on security related issues findings pointing to the negative effects of exposure to violence notably contrast with studies showing pos itive outcomes related to exposure to violence such as increased altruism voors et al and social cohesion gilligan pasquale and samii and with studies in dicating that the effects of exposure to violence may differ depending on local context and institutions hall et al we expect negative effects for two main reasons first many positive social outcomes have been limited to ingroups and did not spill over to outgroups gross man manekin and miodownik hadzic carlson and tavits voors et al second studies on the effects of exposure to violence typically take place long af ter the conclusion of violence providing time for changes in context and institutions that might increase intra and intergroup trust but which are not realized in our study de juan and pierskalla hadzic carlson and tavits hall et al de juan and pierskalla note that the stage of postwar recovery at which trust is measured may play a pivotal role and that negative shortterm effects of violence on trust might dissipate or even reverse over time our selection of south sudan as a case provides a number of potential advantages most important our study was conducted at a time when both sides had re cently agreed to a tentative settlement we are able to show subjects real endorsements of a settlement deal that was highly salient and the fate of which had yet to be determined second we believe that this setting provides a particularly strong test of the outgroup hypothesis in south sudan militia frequently identify individuals by their ethnicity using either visual markers or language tests and single them out for violence center for civil ians in conflict especially in this context we expect individuals to be distrusting of outgroup leaders and to be particularly focused on security in addition it is a low information environment and thus endorsements should convey information the majority of our respondents are of low educational attainment and socioeconomic status and only a minority owned a cell phone see table peo ple overwhelmingly want peace and any result showing that an endorsement decreases support for a peace deal is meaningful but we believe that if such a response exists we are likely to capture it in this context the targeted violence and lowinformation environment in south su dan are also representative of many civil wars giving us confidence that our findings would be generalizable to other conflict settings an uncertain peace in south sudan the south sudanese civil war started in earnest on de cember

who are also represented in this study the third largest at an estimated together izady many other provisions were never implemented and there was significant uncertainty if they would be controlling

to isolate the effects of leader endorsements on support for the tentative peace settlement we conducted an ex periment similar in design to party and group cueing studies conducted in the united states eg nicholson and to work on the peace settlement in colom bia garbirasdiaz garciasanchez and matanock matanock and garbirasdiaz our experiment also draws significantly on the endorsement designs of two studies conducted in afghanistan and pakistan blair et al lyall blair and imai however these latter studies interpret changes in support due to an endorsing party as solely indicating individuals underlying support for that party independent of the policies that parties are said to endorse in our context one characterized by a high degree of violence distrust and low information we echo garbirasdiaz garciasanchez and matanock and matanock and garbirasdiaz in our expectation that endorsements of policies will change in dividuals support for those policies not solely because of the endorsers identity but also because their endorse ments of policies convey information about the costs and benefits of those policies figure displays our experiment design participants were randomly assigned to a control or one of two treat ment conditions in each they were asked how much they agreed with six different policies taken from peace accords signed by kiir and machar00 in treatment conditions the policies were preceded by either the en dorsement of kiirsplm or macharsplmio because the policies are the same in every respect except for the en dorsement of the policy by a political actor in a treatment group any difference in support for settlement policies between a treatment group and the control group is inter preted as representing the effect of information conveyed about the policys costs and benefits due to the political ac tors endorsement if support increases then this suggests that citizens learn from that endorsement that there are greater benefits to the policy if support drops this indi cates that the leaders endorsement suggests greater costs we chose six domestic peace policy reforms a power sharing arrangement national bank reform the estab lishment of a trust and reconciliation commission a new constitution a unified military force and the democrati zation of the splm political party see si appendix l0the first five policies come directly from the august peace accords intergovernmental authority development and the sixth from an earlier accord tribune for a discussion of our choice of treatments and for ex periment materials

educate villagers on the risks of unexploded ordnance and elicit informa tion from them through surveys to identify the density and locations of explosive remnants of war teams were accordingly well versed in obtaining permissions from village chiefs and local authorities and earning the trust of village locals most critically mre teams allowed us to reach additional rural areas that would otherwise be inaccessible to civilian enumerators due to the outbreak of violence our private survey team which had experi ence conducting surveys for the world bank and united nations was utilized primarily in safer urban areas and in locations where mre teams were not operating survey team members worked in groups that included a leader we can thus evaluate changes in support due to information conveyed by endorsements 00the code to calculate the index is available at httpsgithub comcdsamii controlling for whether surveys were collected by mre or private survey teams does not

endorse ment effect is consistent across all six policiesboth for nuer and for dinka respondents findings are robust to the inclusion of controls si table a00 and state fixed effects si table a00 limited variation in dinka and nuer respondents degrees of selfreported exposure to violence makes it dif ficult to draw strong conclusions about the moderating effect of exposure to violence on outgroup leaders en dorsements we present results in si appendix we do not find any evidence of a moderating effect with dinka respondents and we find inconsistent evidence of a mod erating effect using a proxy for exposure to violence that contains greater variation whether one was displaced or not with our nuer subsample shilluk and luo respondents to further investigate the moderating effect of exposure to violence and to test the robustness of our findings the experiment was expanded to include two minority eth nic groups the shilluk and luo these groups can shed additional light on our findings because they have been exposed to violence from different combinations of eth nic outgroups over the course of the civil war whereas the shilluk in our sample had only recently faced extreme ethnically targeted violence exclusively at the hands of splm and dinkaallied groups the luo have faced indis criminate violence from both splmio and splmallied forces00 our outgroup hypothesis predicts that shilluk re spondents should like nuer respondents respond neg atively to dinka endorsements of peace policies because exposure to violence from dinka groups makes them trust dinka leaders less and fear their possible exploitation of peace terms more in contrast because the luo have faced indiscriminate violence from both sides they should not fear one group more than the other our outgroup hy pothesis would accordingly expect them to react similarly to dinka and nuer politician endorsements but does not offer a clear expectation as to whether endorsements will reduce or not

familiarity with ingroup politicians stances which could make ingroup endorsements less informative we think that these alternative explanations are un likely first the raw average levels of support for policies in si figure a0 show that support has not reached a ceil ing and there is still room for it to increase in such a lowinformation environment it is unlikely that respon dents were very knowledgeable about the peace policies let alone politicians policy stances further if differen tial knowledge prior to the experiment was driving re sults we would expect that shilluk and luo respondents who have no coethnic politician at the national level and thus should not have a high degree of knowledge about either politicians stances prior to the study should be swayed either positively or negatively by both politicians endorsements which we do not observe interpretation of outgroup endorsement effect in this section we consider two alternative mechanisms for our negative outgroup endorsement effect findings first conflict could increase social polarization leading individuals to update downward after an outgroup en dorsement not because of security or trust instrumental concerns but rather because of outgroup enmity schol ars have found that identitybased differences can drive political behavior even where groups issuebased differ ences are moderate and ingroup candidates are unpop ular abramowitz and webster iyengar and west wood distinguishing between instrumental and affectbased mechanisms has important normative im plications if people care only about which side wins compromise is unlikely further the aim of using heuris tics is not to act as if one was informed undermining its central theorized benefit iyengar and westwood lupia conflict is likely to increase social polarization but we do not think it is the sole driver of our results first we would expect that luo respondents who faced violence from both sides would respond negatively to endorse ments from both dinka and nuer politicians in contrast individuals appear to respond negatively to endorsements only from outgroups that constitute a particular threat to their personal safety eg when they are only targeted by that group for violence and not by the alternative group second given the overwhelming desire for peace we be lieve that people will be instrumentally

while most studies on social polar ization emphasize the role of outgroup enmity they still anticipate and observe a positive ingroup effect and high ingroup loyalty which we do not observe abramowitz and webster iyengar and westwood fourth a factor analysis si appendix shows that the six en dorsement questions load on two factors importantly the two questions for which security concerns are likely to be most pressing one on powersharing and the sec ond on joint control of security forces most clearly load on one factor whereas the remaining four endorsement questions most clearly define the other analysis is robust to using either factor as the dependent variable a second alternative explanation of our results is that people respond negatively to endorsements from out group leaders not due to security concerns but because they fear that outgroup leaders will exclude them from government patronage a factor analysis indicates that the endorsement question most likely to pick up on fear of capture of material benefits on revisions to the national bank does not load on a different factor than the others we also added a question to the survey with luo respon dents to measure perceived ethnic bias in the distribution of public goods we do observe that a nuer endorsement increases support among luo respondents who believe that leaders are ethnically biased by standard devia tions confidence interval this effect appears to be driven primarily by an increase in support for the banking endorsement question results reported in this article are robust to excluding this question although we argue that security concerns play a key role in how individuals interpret endorsements outgroup animus and material concerns may also explain some component of our observed effect

broken down because splm always wanted to dominate nondinkas and rule the government with dinkas only nuer civilians were said to be scared to trust the splm government in fill filling the peace deal leaders insisted that their fears of the other side were not due to hate but rather to a deep distrust00 one dinka village chief said we dont hate the opposition but they have to be more loyal and fulfill their commitments as regards this peace deal both groups listed guaranteeing security among their top three priorities for achieving peace potentially consistent with this account are the high import civil ians in the world banks high frequency survey attach to facilitat ing healing between communities ranking such efforts only behind an end to fighting as the best way to bring peace to south sudan leaders described a lowinformation environment they said that they only learned about peace deal provi sions during briefings from leadership a source of infor mation unavailable to civilians a splmio deputy com mander observed that some of the things in the peace deal are not understandable to the people there was also evidence that some followers had grown weary of in group leaders promises and a dinka village chief noted this peace process is significant because south sudanese citizens are tired with prolonged years of war focus group discussions and accounts detailing how leaders on both sides in south sudan were able to rely on critical support from coethnic communities even as they escalated violence and violated the peace deal indicate that lower civilian support for peace deals might have consequential effects where civilians apply less pressure on ingroup elites and on communities to comply with settlement terms a nuer governor the highest statelevel public office insisted that there was accountability if this content downloaded from on fri mar all use subject to nicholas haas and prabin b khadka civilians withdraw their support then kiir and machar both will be out leaders stressed that civilians had an equal role in making the peace deal successful a splm io military commander recalled instances where people forced us to oblige with implementation of the agreements on time and improvement of security a dinka village chief stated that the key role of civilians was to spread the positive message of the peace deal by not engaging in intercommunal violence or cattle raiding which could imperil ontheground settlement implementation conclusion we present results from a largescale survey experiment conducted during a brief pause in civil war violence in south sudan in we find that support for a tenta tive peace deal drops precipitously when policies are en dorsed by outgroup leaders and suggestive evidence that negative effects are greatest for those whose communities were targeted most violently by that outgroup ingroup politician endorsements do not significantly alter indi viduals support for the peace settlement we conclude that a policy from a distrusted outgroup leader conveys information namely that the leader sees a way to ex ploit the policy and makes individuals valuing security above all else less likely to support that policy how can public support for peace settlements signed by leaders from warring groups be increased our study indicates that providing policy information may not be sufficient to overcome citizens fears of outgroup leaders efforts to increase intergroup trust to build and commu nicate safeguards against outgroup exploitation and to increase inclusion of civilians and given
