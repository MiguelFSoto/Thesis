Leader Endorsements Undercut Public Support for

Abstract: Civil wars are a greater source of violence than any other type of conflict, yet little is known about one of the key 
determinants of civil war peace settlement success: civilian support We evaluate how a core component of nearly all peace 
settlements, leader endorsements, affects public support. We predict that individuals in conflict settings will view settlements 
endorsed by outgroup leaders as less trustworthy and that they will become less supportive. We conduct an endorsement 
experiment with nearly 1,000 respondents in South Sudan in 2016, taking advantage of a brief cessation in a devastating 
civil war. Public support for a tentative settlement drops precipitously when it is endorsed by an outgroup leader but does 
not increase when it is endorsed by an ingroup leader. We find suggestive evidence that effects are strongest for individuals 
with the greatest reason to fear outgroup leaders: those whose communities were targeted most violently by that outgroup.

flict as a source of violence (Pettersson, Hogbladh, and 
Oberg 2019). Scholars seeking to explain variation in 
the success of negotiated peace settlements to durably 
end civil conflicts have identified two key determinants.1 
First, settlement content matters: The presence of provi- 
sions that solve commitment problems for warring par- 
ties, or the ability of one group to credibly commit to the 
other that it will not renege on settlement terms once in 
power (Fearon 1998), increases the likelihood of durable 
peace. Second, settlement implementation can be a pow- 
erful predictor of settlement success (Hartzell and Hoddie 
2003; Joshi and Quinn 2017). Implementation of useful provisions like those that solve commitment problems 
can have significant positive direct effects. Implementa- 
tion can also serve as a costly signal of a commitment to 
long-term peace by groups in power (Hartzell and Hoddie 
2003; Joshi and Quinn 2017). 
In this article, we investigate how leader endorse- 
ments shape public opinion toward peace settlements 
during ongoing conflicts. There is abundant evi- 
dence that public opinion affects the two primary 
drivers of settlement success - settlement content and 
implementation - but until recently, civilian attitudes 
have not attracted significant scholarly attention 
(Garbiras-Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock 2019; 
Matanock and Garcia-Sanchez 2017). Civilians most 
clearly weigh in on the peace process when terms or

the settlement itself is subject to referendum. But public 
opinion can also shape settlement negotiations and 
implementation when no referenda are held, or when a 
settlement has already been approved, with important 
implications for settlement success (Nilsson2012). Recent 
civilian-led protests in Sudan resulted both in changes 
in leadership and the terms of transition until planned 
democratic elections (Associated Press 2019). Leaders of- 
ten use unfavorable public opinion polls and the threat of 
referenda to gain leverage in peace deal negotiations and 
to put constraints on possible settlement content. For in- 
stance, Israel in 2010 passed a law requiring a referendum 
to approve any peace deal in which territory was ceded. 
The referendum requirement was widely interpreted as 
an effort to take land-for-peace deals off the negotiating 
table, as most surveys showed a majority of citizens 
opposing such terms (Kershner 2010). Peace deals that are 
passed without widespread civilian support or involve- 
ment, or for which support wanes following their passage, 
risk falling short of full implementation, as constituents 
are less likely to hold politicians accountable for reneging 
on settlement terms they do not support or view as 
legitimate and may even pressure them to do so (Nilsson 
2012). Although Colombia's Congress ultimately passed 
a peace deal in November 2016 - bypassing a second ref- 
erendum after the first settlement proposal was narrowly 
rejected by voters in October - its implementation has 
lagged in core areas and significant uncertainty looms 
(Casey 2019).2 Kew and John (2008) find that indirect 
and direct civil society participation in peace negotia- 
tions are associated with greater durability of negotiated 
peace.
We experimentally evaluate how endorsements from 
real leaders of two parties engaged in an ethnic civil war in 
South Sudan affect civilian support for a tentative peace 
settlement. We specifically focus on how leader endorse- 
ments affect public opinion of a peace settlement for three 
key reasons. First, we study an aspect of an ongoing set- 
tlement process with relevance to a large number of cases. 
Endorsements by parties pursuant to the agreement ac- 
company nearly all peace settlements: Parties typically 
endorse the settlement not only through their signatures, 
but also through written statements and spoken words 
at signing ceremonies. Second, there is good reason to 
expect that endorsements are especially impactful in low- 
information conflict settings and concerning complicated 
peace provisions. Research shows that uninformed citi- 
zens often use political endorsements as a cognitive short- 
2 Although implementation in Colombia has advanced in some areas, the Kroc Institute (2018) found that over two-thirds of stip- 
ulations had either been minimally implemented (31%) or not initiated at all (39%). cut to decide which candidate or policy to support and, 
thus, to act "as if' they were informed (Arceneaux and 
Kolodny 2009; Broockman and Butler 2017; Garbiras- 
Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock 2019; Lupia 1994; 
Minozzi et al. 2015). Further, citizens are likely to have 
strong feelings about different leaders, to whom they may 
alternatively attribute violent actions, heroic resistance, or 
gross incompetence. Third, endorsements of settlements 
are of theoretical interest. Scholars have found that con- 
flict can change individuals' priorities and emotions, but 
we lack knowledge regarding how these changes might 
interact with individuals' interpretations of leader en- 
dorsements of peace settlements. 
The extant literature indicates that effects of leader 
endorsements of complex peace provisions should differ 
depending on a respondent's perception of the endorser. 
Individuals have been found to respond differently to 
cues from sources they trust and whom they see as shar- 
ing common interests, values, and an identity, as com- 
pared with sources who do not have these characteristics 
(Arceneaux and Kolodny 2009; Coan et al. 2008; Lupia 
1994). In the context we study, where individuals were 
targeted for violence based on ethnic markers (Center for 
Civilians in Conflict 2016), the ethnic identity of leaders 
is likely to condition how individuals respond to their 
endorsements. However, although the literature points 
us toward considering whether a leader and respondent 
share an ethnic identity, it does not offer clear predic- 
tions as to how endorsements should operate in conflict 
settings. We thus draw on the literature to propose two 
hypotheses but note that ex ante , effects from in and 
outgroup leaders could plausibly shift support in multi- 
ple directions. 
A number of studies have found that endorsements 
from ingroup political elites tend to increase support for 
a policy, particularly over complex issues (Brader and 
Tucker 2012; Coan et al. 2008; Garbiras-Díaz, Garcia- 
Sanchez, and Matanock 2019; Minozzi et al. 2015). Vi- 
olence can tighten group boundaries and lead to greater 
ingroup cohesion and coethnic support (Hadzic, Carlson, 
and Tavits 2020; Rohner, Thoenig, and Zilibotti 2013); if 
individuals blame outgroup leaders for the continuation 
of violence and believe that their ingroup leaders are rep- 
resenting their interests the best they can under difficult 
circumstances, then we should expect ingroup endorse- 
ments to have a positive effect on support for peace set- 
tlements. Our Ingroup Hypothesis draws on these stud- 
ies to propose that individuals should be more likely to 
support peace settlement terms endorsed by ingroup po- 
litical elites. 
However, there is reason to question the applicabil- 
ity of these findings to the conflict setting we study. In

contexts such as South Sudan, where both sides have 
been repeatedly blamed for relapses in violence and bro- 
ken peace deals, ingroup leaders may not emerge com- 
pletely unscathed in the eyes of their coethnics (De Juan 
and Pierskalla 2016; de Vries and Schomerus 2017; Lyall, 
Blair, and Imai 2013). If people begin to question the 
ability of ingroup leaders to deliver peace, then a non- 
credible but nonthreatening ingroup endorsement may 
not convey new information about the costs and bene- 
fits of the policy and may not lead individuals to update 
their level of support. In other contexts that feature high 
intergroup polarization and outgroup distrust, scholars 
have found that outgroup endorsements conveyed more 
information than did ingroup endorsements, which had 
no or very little effect on policy preferences (Arceneaux 
and Kolodny 2009; Lupia 1994; Nicholson 2012). Finally, 
an ingroup endorsement could decrease support if in- 
dividuals begin to question their leaders' intentions and 
interests. 
Expectations regarding the effects of outgroup lead- 
ers' endorsements are similarly mixed. Scholars have 
found that elites can be persuasive among the general pop- 
ulation, and even with outgroup constituents (Broock- 
man and Butler 2017; Minozzi et al. 2015). If people feel 
that outgroup leaders will represent them and their inter- 
ests well, then outgroup leader endorsements could lead 
to increases in support. Where outgroup leaders are not 
viewed as having expertise or as being threatening, their 
endorsements may have little effect on support. A third 
possibility that has found support in other contexts is 
that outgroup leader endorsements will lead to decreases 
in support (Arceneaux and Kolodny 2009; Lupia 1994; 
Lyall, Blair, and Imai 2013; Matanock and Garbiras-Diaz 
2018; Nicholson 2012). Outgroup endorsements may es- 
pecially decrease support in conflict settings. First, con- 
flict can make individuals more distrustful of outgroup 
leaders and individuals (Beber, Roessler, and Scacco 2014; 
Flail et al. 2018; Hetherington and Suhay 2011). Second, 
studies have found that conflict and threat may lead indi- 
viduals to put a greater priority on security, as opposed to 
other considerations such as equality, democracy, or the 
uncertain future that a peace deal promises (Berrebi and 
Klor 2008; Huddy and Feldman 201 1; Phayal 2016). Our 
Outgroup Hypothesis posits that individuals should be 
less likely to support a peace deal endorsed by outgroup 
political elites. 
To evaluate these competing hypotheses, we con- 
ducted an endorsement experiment with a diverse ar- 
ray of nearly 1,000 respondents in South Sudan in early 
2016, when there was a brief lull in civil war violence 
between the ethnically Dinka-associated Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement (SPLM), led by the incumbent president Salva Kiir, and the ethnically Nuer-associated 
SPLM-In Opposition (SPLM-IO), led by ousted vice 
president Riek Machar. Participants were randomly as- 
signed to receive policy questions with no endorsement 
or with an endorsement by a political actor of inter- 
est, either SPLM/Kiir or SPLM-IO/Machar. We estimate 
the effects of in and outgroup leader endorsements on 
support by considering Dinka and Nuer respondents 
(n = 491). We supplement these results with analyses 
of two minority ethnic groups, the Shilluk (n = 59) 
and Luo (n = 330), that had vastly different wartime 
experiences. 
We find support for the Outgroup Hypothesis but not 
the Ingroup Hypothesis. For both Dinka and Nuer sub- 
jects, support drops significantly for peace deals when 
they are endorsed by an ethnic outgroup leader, but 
it does not change significantly following the endorse- 
ment of an ingroup leader. We find suggestive evidence 
that the negative effect of an outgroup endorsement is 
strongest for individuals whose communities were tar- 
geted most violently by that outgroup. There is inconsis- 
tent evidence that the outgroup effect is moderated by 
the effect of being displaced among Nuer respondents. 
Where a group (Shilluk respondents) has been targeted 
by one side in the dispute, an endorsement from that 
side's leader decreases support for the peace deal, but en- 
dorsements from leaders who have not targeted the group 
do not significantly alter support. Where a group (Luo 
respondents) has faced similar levels of violence from 
both leaders, endorsements do not significantly change 
support. 
Our study makes a number of contributions to the 
extant literature. First, it advances a nascent literature 
on public opinion toward peace deals - and the role that 
leaders' endorsements play in swaying views (Garbiras- 
Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock 2019; Matanock 
and Garbiras-Diaz 2018; Matanock and Garcia-Sanchez 
2017). Second, it elucidates how conflict may affect in- 
dividuals' responses to endorsements in particular ways. 
Third, we take a different tack from much excellent previ- 
ous work on ethnic conflict, focusing on the determinants 
of support for policies that may result in peace, rather than 
on how candidate selection can contribute to or alterna- 
tively damage prospects for peace.3 Fourth, we extend 
research on how conflict and fear affect attitudes and 
preferences to consider how they can shape views toward 
peace deals.

uals support ethnic candidates or political parties (e.g., Chandra 2004).

Theory and Hypotheses 
How should we expect citizens to respond to leaders' 
endorsements of peace settlements? An extensive liter- 
ature has found that citizens often utilize political en- 
dorsements as information shortcuts, or heuristics, to 
make decisions about a wide range of outcomes, includ- 
ing preferred policies and candidates (Arceneaux and 
Kolodny 2009; Broockman and Butler 2017; Garbiras- 
Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock 2019; Lupia 1994; 
Minozzi et al. 2015). These heuristics allow citizens to 
reduce the costs of making complex decisions that would 
otherwise be cognitively taxing both in terms of effort (in- 
formation collection) and capacity (processing; Chaiken, 
Liberman, and Eagly 1989). Political endorsements from 
trusted and familiar sources indicate that the policy or 
candidate under consideration is good and would advance 
the respondent's interests; endorsements from distrusted 
sources may indicate the opposite. Through adopting in- 
formational shortcuts, uninformed citizens may cheaply 
emulate the behavior of more knowledgeable individuals 
(Lupia 1994). 
Scholars have often found that individuals respond 
differently to endorsements from elites with a shared 
identity. However, the literature does not provide clear 
predictions as to how endorsements of peace settlements 
from in and outgroup leaders should affect public sup- 
port in conflict settings (see Table A24 in the supporting 
information [SI]). In what follows, we review the litera- 
tures on in and outgroup endorsement effects and derive 
two hypotheses for how they might operate in conflict 
settings. 
Ingroup Endorsements 
A number of studies have found that ingroup endorse- 
ments can significantly increase support for policies and 
candidates (Brader and Tucker 2012; Coan et al. 2008; 
Garbiras-Díaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock 2019; Mi- 
nozzi et al. 2015).4 Coan et al. (2008) conduct a lab exper- 
iment in the United States in which they randomly assign 
subjects to receive endorsements from either the Repub- 
lican Party, one of two smaller parties (Green or Reform), 
or no party, on issues ranging from abortion (least com- 
plex or new) to class action lawsuits (most difficult and 
unexplored). They find that individuals are significantly 
more likely to adopt the issue positions of parties with

an ingroup elite's position was driven by an ingroup endorsement, 
an outgroup endorsement, or both. SI Table A24. which they are familiar and trust, and where the issue 
area is complex. Brader and Tucker (2012) conduct party 
cue endorsement experiments with subjects from three 
countries: Britain, Hungary, and Poland. They find that 
ingroup endorsements increase support and that effects 
are stronger in countries with more established party sys- 
tems, where partisanship is a salient identity and parties 
have established clear reputations. 
To our knowledge, Garbiras-Díaz, Garcia-Sanchez, 
and Matanock (2019) and Matanock and Garbiras-Díaz 
(2018) present the only other experimental evidence on 
peace policy endorsements, in Colombia where there was 
an extended civil war between the government and a 
rebel group, FARC. Whereas the former study includes 
endorsements from two government officiais and dis- 
tinguishes between ingroups and outgroups on the ba- 
sis of stated affinity with each leader, the latter study 
only includes endorsements from FARC, which due to 
its widespread unpopularity the authors treat as an 
"outgroup" for all respondents. Garbiras-Díaz, Garcia- 
Sanchez, and Matanock (2019) find that an endorsement 
from one politician (former President Uribe) significantly 
increases support among affiliating respondents, but they 
do not find parallel results for the other (President San- 
tos). Research has shown that outgroup violence can lead 
individuals to support an ingroup, but that ingroup vio- 
lence does not result in outgroup gains; this "home team 
discount" suggests that ingroup leaders may largely avoid 
blame despite the continuation of violence (Lyall, Blair, 
and Imai 2013, 696). If people blame the outgroup for 
violence but not the ingroup, and if conflict increases eth- 
nic identification and coethnic support (Hadzic, Carlson, 
and Tavits 2020; Rohner, Thoenig, and Zilibotti 2013), 
then positive ingroup endorsement effects may even be 
greater in conflict settings. 
Ingroup Hypothesis . Individuals should be more likely 
to support peace settlement terms that are endorsed by 
ingroup political elites. Endorsements from outgroup po- 
litical elites may increase, decrease, or not have an effect 
on support. 
There are a number of reasons why ingroup en- 
dorsements may not generate increases in support for 
peace provisions in conflict settings. In nonconflict set- 
tings characterized by intergroup polarization or higher 
outgroup distrust than ingroup trust - two features we 
expect to be strongly present in many conflict settings, 
as we discuss below - scholars have found that ingroup 
endorsements have little to no effect on support for poli- 
cies, possibly because they convey less information than 
outgroup endorsements (Arceneaux and Kolodny 2009; 
Lupia 1994; Nicholson 2012). Additionally, in conflict

settings, blame for persistent violence may permeate in- 
dividuals' perceptions of ingroup leaders, whose contin- 
ued failures to deliver peace could make their subsequent 
promises to do so seem noncredible. If ingroup endorse- 
ments appear both noncredible and nonthreatening, then 
they may not convey new information about costs and 
benefits of a policy or lead individuals to update their 
level of support. De Juan and Pierskalla (2016, 71) ar- 
gue that the failure of a group to protect its supporters 
"communicates low competence"; in South Sudan, there 
is evidence that civilians do not view as credible calls for 
peace from either side (de Vries and Schomerus 2017). 
We believe that this theory could be consistent with at 
least two possible interpretations of results from Garbiras- 
Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock (2019). First, the 
authors find that an ingroup endorsement in 2017 from 
Uribe, who was last president in 2010, increased sup- 
port, but that an ingroup endorsement from President 
Santos, who served until 2018, did not. These asymmet- 
ric results may be explained by individuals attributing 
greater blame for failures to the ingroup leader currently 
in power, Santos, but not to an ex-president, Uribe. Sec- 
ond, as Matanock and Garbiras-Diaz (2018) show, in the 
Colombian context, FARC was very unpopular with the 
vast majority of citizens. Where everyone agrees that one 
group is responsible for violence, alternative elites, in this 
case both Santos and Uribe, may to a large degree es- 
cape blame for violence. The findings from Matanock 
and Garbiras-Diaz (2018) thus suggest possible bounds 
on the theory proposed above. First, for individuals to 
attribute blame to ingroup leaders, those leaders should 
be seen as recently making decisions that impacted the 
peace process. Second, there must be some uncertainty 
over who is responsible for violence: In settings such as 
Colombia where a guerrilla group waged an insurgent 
campaign against the government, individuals on one 
side (the government) may largely avoid blame.5 
Finally, an ingroup endorsement could decrease sup- 
port if blame for continued violence leads individuals to 
doubt both in and outgroup leaders' intentions. If an in- 
group leader is seen as advancing interests contrary to 
one's own, then just as with an outgroup leader, their en- 
dorsement of a policy may signal that it is costly. Although 
Lyall, Blair, and Imai (2013, 692) find that people respond 
asymmetrically to violence perpetrated by ingroups and 
outgroups, they still find that in the aggregate, neither side 
is popular; in a number of regions, endorsements from 
both sides decrease support for policies, which the au-

olence where the group is seen as a foreign occupying force, as in 
the context of Lyall, Blair, and Imai's (2013) study. thors attribute to a "backdrop of war weariness in which 
neither combatant is especially favored." 
Outgroup Endorsements 
As with ingroup endorsements, the literature indicates 
that outgroup endorsements in conflict settings could 
shift support of peace provisions in multiple direc- 
tions. Scholars have found that politicians' endorsements 
can shift policy support in the intended direction with 
the general population, including outgroup constituents. 
Minozzi et al. (2015) show that copartisans and other 
constituents find their U.S. members of Congress sim- 
ilarly persuasive. Broockman and Butler (2017) do not 
observe that Democratic state legislators are less persua- 
sive with constituents who do not approve of Democratic 
president Barack Obama. If a belief that national politi- 
cians represent everyone's interests is sufficient to override 
salient identity divisions, then outgroup leader endorse- 
ments could result in increases in policy support. Out- 
group leader endorsements could also result in little to 
no shift in policy preferences if outgroup leaders are seen 
as having different interests but are not viewed as partic- 
ularly credible or threatening, or where they do not have 
an established reputation. 
A third possibility is that outgroup leader endorse- 
ments in conflict settings will signal that a policy is 
costly and will decrease support. Even in nonconflict 
settings, endorsements from distrusted outgroup lead- 
ers have been found to result in substantial decreases in 
support for policies ( Arceneaux and Kolodny 2009; Lupia 
1994; Nicholson 2012). We posit that negative outgroup 
effects are likely to be even stronger in conflict settings 
for two reasons. First, conflict is likely to reduce trust 
in outgroup leaders and individuals. Individuals with 
greater threat perception and who have been targeted 
for violence are more intolerant, are less trusting, and 
seek more punitive measures against outgroups (Beber, 
Roessler, and Scacco 2014; Hall et al. 2018; Hethering- 
ton and Suhay 2011). Blair et al. (2013) attribute lower 
support for militant groups among the urban poor to 
that group's greater exposure to terrorist violence and its 
negative externalities. Lyall, Blair, and Imai (2013) sim- 
ilarly find that victimization from an outgroup leads to 
a drop in support for that group. These studies suggest 
that individuals in conflict settings will be less trusting 
of outgroup leaders and more fearful that an outgroup 
endorsement of a policy indicates that the leader sees an 
opportunity for further exploitation. 
Second, individuals in conflict settings may become 
more likely to prioritize security above other concerns.

People who perceive a greater threat have been found to 
favor aggressive foreign policy (Hetherington and Suhay 
201 1; Huddy and Feldman 201 1) and to be more willing 
to exchange personal liberties for security and for leaders 
who are punitive, conservative, or nationalist (Berrebi and 
Klor 2008; Phayal 2016). In sum, we propose that conflict 
may significantly reduce individuals' trust in outgroup 
leaders and shift their priorities toward security. These 
changes lead us to expect that individuals should be less 
likely to support peace settlement terms that are endorsed 
by outgroup leaders. Where individuals' central concern 
is security, and where the central threat to that security 
comes from heavily distrusted outgroup leaders, an out- 
group endorsement of peace terms vulnerable to exploita- 
tion may draw particular attention from respondents and 
reduce their support. 
Outgroup Hypothesis. Individuals should be less likely 
to support a peace deal when it is endorsed by outgroup 
political elites. Effects should be strongest for those who 
perceive the most threat from the outgroup. Endorse- 
ments from ingroup political elites may increase, decrease, 
or not have an effect on support. 
Divergent findings in Garbiras-Diaz, Garcia- 
Sanchez, and Matanock (2019) and Matanock and 
Garbiras-Diaz (2018) in Colombia may highlight how 
endorsements from outgroups that have engaged in vi- 
olence are perceived as particularly negative signals of a 
policy's merits. When the outgroup elite is a politician one 
holds in low esteem (but who has not violently targeted 
supporters of the alternative elite), his endorsement does 
not result in decreases in support for peace provisions 
(Garbiras-Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock 2019). In 
contrast, when the outgroup is a rebel group that en- 
gaged in guerrilla warfare, their endorsement results in a 
significant drop in support for provisions (Matanock and 
Garbiras-Diaz 2018). 
We posit that exposure to violence may moderate a 
negative outgroup endorsement effect. Exposure to vi- 
olence has been shown to increase fear and distrust of 
and lower support for outgroups (Beber, Roessler, and 
Scacco 2014; Blair et al. 2013; Grossman, Manekin, and 
Miodownik 2015; Hadzic, Carlson, and Tavits 2020). 
De Juan and Pierskalla (2016) find that those exposed 
to greater violence have less trust in leaders who failed 
to protect them. Berrebi and Klor (2008, 289) argue that 
Israeli voters become more supportive of far-right polit- 
ical parties following terror attacks because those parties 
place "more weight on security- related issues." 
Findings pointing to the negative effects of exposure 
to violence notably contrast with studies showing pos- 
itive outcomes related to exposure to violence, such as increased altruism (Voors et al. 2012) and social cohesion 
(Gilligan, Pasquale, and Samii 2014), and with studies in- 
dicating that the effects of exposure to violence may differ 
depending on local context and institutions (Hall et al. 
2018). We expect negative effects for two main reasons. 
First, many positive social outcomes have been limited 
to ingroups and did not spill over to outgroups (Gross- 
man, Manekin, and Miodownik 2015; Hadzic, Carlson, 
and Tavits 2020; Voors et al. 2012). Second, studies on the 
effects of exposure to violence typically take place long af- 
ter the conclusion of violence, providing time for changes 
in context and institutions that might increase intra and 
intergroup trust but which are not realized in our study 
(De Juan and Pierskalla 2016; Hadzic, Carlson, and Tavits 
2020; Hall et al. 2018). De Juan and Pierskalla (2016, 71) 
note that "the stage of postwar recovery at which trust 
is measured may play a pivotal role" and that negative 
short-term effects of violence on trust might dissipate, or 
even reverse, over time. 
Our selection of South Sudan as a case provides a 
number of potential advantages. Most important, our 
study was conducted at a time when both sides had re- 
cently agreed to a tentative settlement. We are able to 
show subjects real endorsements of a settlement deal that 
was highly salient and the fate of which had yet to be 
determined. Second, we believe that this setting provides 
a particularly strong test of the Outgroup Hypothesis. In 
South Sudan, militia frequently identify individuals by 
their ethnicity, using either visual markers or language 
tests, and single them out for violence (Center for Civil- 
ians in Conflict 20 1 6) : Especially in this context, we expect 
individuals to be distrusting of outgroup leaders and to be 
particularly focused on security. In addition, it is a low- 
information environment and thus endorsements should 
convey information: The majority of our respondents are 
of low educational attainment and socioeconomic status, 
and only a minority owned a cell phone (see Table 3) . Peo- 
ple overwhelmingly want peace, and any result showing 
that an endorsement decreases support for a peace deal is 
meaningful, but we believe that if such a response exists, 
we are likely to capture it in this context. The targeted 
violence and low-information environment in South Su- 
dan are also representative of many civil wars, giving us 
confidence that our findings would be generalizable to 
other conflict settings. 
An Uncertain Peace in South Sudan

Table 1 Timeline of Events 
July 2013 President Kiir dismisses cabinet, Vice President Riek Machar. 
December 2013 Kiir accuses Machar, 10 others of coup. Kiir-allied forces patrol Juba, killing Nuers; Machar flees 
Juba, and ethnic civil war begins. 
August 2015 Peace accords signed, with transitional government until elections in 2018. 
April 2016 Machar returns with troops to Juba, and is sworn in as vice president in accordance with deal. 
July 2016 Fighting breaks out between Dinka/Nuer- allied troops; Machar flees Juba. Civil war resumes. 
Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, started killing ethnic Nuers 
while patrolling Juba, the nation's capital (see Table 1 
and SI Figure Al).6 Most accounts attribute the outbreak 
of violence to elite maneuvering for power and control 
over a dwindling pot of resources. In July, Kiir had dis- 
missed the majority of his cabinet, led by Vice President 
Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. The cabinet members' in- 
creasing rent demands coupled with a breakdown in ne- 
gotiations with Sudan that had temporarily shut down 
oil production meant that Kiir could no longer afford 
to divert funds to his colleagues, and he accordingly re- 
placed them with cheaper alternatives (de Waal 2014). On 
December 15, the fragile arrangement crumbled when 
Kiir accused Machar and 10 others of trying to unseat 
him in a coup (Radon and Logan 2014). Machar fled 
Juba the following day and became the de facto leader of 
the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-In Opposition 
(SPLM-IO). 
Despite numerous attempts at peace brokering by the 
international community, including one that culminated 
in a lengthy peace agreement to which both sides for- 
mally agreed in August 2015, fighting has continued. This 
study exploits a brief period of de-escalation in conflict 
between February and late summer 2016, during which 
time Machar, in accordance with one of the terms of the 
2015 peace accords, returned to the nation's capital for 
the first time since the outbreak of the civil war to again 
assume the role of vice president.7 In late July, most hope 
for peace in the near future disappeared when Kiir again 
dismissed Machar, who fled the capital as he had before.8 
SI Figure Al shows how violence increased soon after 
this period. 
6 Ethnic Dinkas (36% of the country's population) and Nuers 
(16%) comprise the two largest ethnic groups in South Sudan, 
with Shilluks and Luo, who are also represented in this study, the 
third largest at an estimated 9% together (Izady 201 1). 
7 Many other provisions were never implemented, and there was 
significant uncertainty if they would be. 
8 Controlling for surveys conducted before and after Machar s re- 
turn (only conducted with a portion of Luo respondents) does not alter results. From the start, the prevailing view was that vio- 
lence was caused by elites and not by ethnic hostilities 
between civilians (Radon and Logan 2014).9 Even Kiir's 
claim of a coup on December 15 did not necessarily im- 
ply an ethnic dimension: Only two of the 1 1 politicians 
accused were Nuer, fewer than the six Dinka (Radon and 
Logan 2014). However, the costs of the civil war have 
been largely concentrated on civilians. Over 2.3 million 
civilians - approximately one in every five people - have 
been displaced, and an estimated 50,000-300,000 have 
lost their lives (Kristof 2016). Of the over 2,800 violent 
events in South Sudan compiled in the Armed Conflict 
Location and Event Data Project (ACLED; Raleigh et al. 
2010) from the start of the war on December 15, 2013, 
to December 3, 2016, over 34% were coded as violence 
against civilians (see Table 2). Even that is a heavy un- 
derestimation of the costs faced by civilians, as it over- 
looks more local-level and small-scale violence against 
civilians, anticipation of violence that has led millions to 
flee their homes, and economic and social costs (de Waal 
2014).
9See de Waal (2014) for more on why violence took on an ethnic di- mension.

Research Design 
Endorsement Experiment 
To isolate the effects of leader endorsements on support 
for the tentative peace settlement, we conducted an ex- 
periment similar in design to party and group cueing 
studies conducted in the United States (e.g., Nicholson 
2012) and to work on the peace settlement in Colom- 
bia (Garbiras-Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock 2019; 
Matanock and Garbiras-Diaz 2018). Our experiment also 
draws significantly on the endorsement designs of two 
studies conducted in Afghanistan and Pakistan (Blair et al. 
2013; Lyall, Blair, and Imai 2013). However, these latter 
studies interpret changes in support due to an endorsing 
party as solely indicating individuals' underlying support 
for that party, independent of the policies that parties are 
said to endorse. In our context - one characterized by a 
high degree of violence, distrust, and low information - 
we echo Garbiras-Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and Matanock 
(2019) and Matanock and Garbiras-Diaz (2018) in our 
expectation that endorsements of policies will change in- 
dividuals' support for those policies not solely because 
of the endorser's identity but also because their endorse- 
ments of policies convey information about the costs and 
benefits of those policies. 
Figure 1 displays our experiment design. Participants 
were randomly assigned to a control or one of two treat- 
ment conditions. In each, they were asked how much 
they agreed with six different policies taken from 2015 
peace accords signed by Kiir and Machar.10 In treatment 
conditions, the policies were preceded by either the en- 
dorsement of Kiir/SPLM or Machar/SPLM-IO. Because 
the policies are the same in every respect except for the en- 
dorsement of the policy by a political actor in a treatment 
group, any difference in support for settlement policies 
between a treatment group and the control group is inter- 
preted as representing the effect of information conveyed 
about the policy's costs and benefits due to the political ac- 
tor's endorsement. If support increases, then this suggests 
that citizens learn from that endorsement that there are 
greater benefits to the policy. If support drops, this indi- 
cates that the leader's endorsement suggests greater costs. 
We chose six domestic peace policy reforms: a power- 
sharing arrangement, national bank reform, the estab- 
lishment of a trust and reconciliation commission, a new 
constitution, a unified military force, and the democrati- 
zation of the SPLM political party (see SI Appendix 2.2 
l0The first five policies come directly from the August 2015 peace 
accords (Intergovernmental Authority Development 20 1 5) , and the sixth from an earlier 2015 accord (Tribune 2015). for a discussion of our choice of treatments and for ex- 
periment materials). 
Respondents rated their level of support for each pro- 
posal on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from not at all to 
a great deal (Blair et al. 2013). 11 These responses were 
combined into a standardized "support index" for the 
six peace policy reforms using inverse covariance weight- 
ing (ICW) as outlined by Anderson (2008). 12 ICW in- 
creases the statistical power of our tests and addresses 
concerns about multiple comparisons (Mvukiyehe and 
Samii 2017). The index is reported in pooled out- 
come standard deviations (Cohen's d statistic). Follow- 
ing Mvukiyehe and Samii (2017), for all tests we report 
both index outcomes with nominal p-values and indi- 
vidual endorsement question outcomes that make up the 
index with false discovery rate (FDR) -controlled p-values 
(Benjamíni and Hochberg 1995). In SI Appendix 6 and 
8.3, we also show the robustness of results to, respec- 
tively, using simple policy support averages and to factor 
analysis. 
Site Implementation and Execution 
The endorsement experiment was first administered to 
Dinka and Nuer respondents and later expanded to in- 
clude Shilluk and Luo respondents. Surveys were con- 
ducted by two experienced teams: the Danish Refugee 
Council's (DRC) mine risk education (MRE) team and a 
private survey company.13 MRE teams educate villagers 
on the risks of unexploded ordnance and elicit informa- 
tion from them through surveys to identify the density 
and locations of explosive remnants of war. Teams were 
accordingly well versed in obtaining permissions from 
village chiefs and local authorities and earning the trust 
of village locals. Most critically, MRE teams allowed us 
to reach additional rural areas that would otherwise be 
inaccessible to civilian enumerators due to the outbreak 
of violence. Our private survey team, which had experi- 
ence conducting surveys for the World Bank and United 
Nations, was utilized primarily in safer urban areas and in 
locations where MRE teams were not operating. Survey 
team members worked in groups that included a leader 
11 We can thus evaluate changes in support due to information 
conveyed by endorsements. 
12The code to calculate the index is available at https://github. com/cdsamii. 
13 Controlling for whether surveys were collected by MRE or private 
survey teams does not alter results. Results do not appear to be 
driven by enumerator error and are robust to including enumerator 
fixed effects; see SI Appendix 8.4.

and if necessary a translator.14 Surveys were then trans- 
lated into English and sent to the researchers. To ensure 
the safety of enumerators, overcome language barriers, 
and increase the comfort of respondents, where possible 
enumerators' ethnicities were matched to respondent eth- 
nicity. 
One of the principal investigators for this project had 
previously worked as a DRC quality assurance officer and 
had conducted in-person data collection trainings with 
MRE and private survey team leaders. We conducted addi- 
tional training sessions with team leaders for this project 
remotely. Team leaders then trained and oversaw data 
collection administered by their team members. Teams 
followed a three-step process: first, they randomly se- 
lected villages from those accessible in the area, as they 
did not have the capacity to visit them all; second, they 
divided villages into blocks to ensure that respondents 
were evenly geographically distributed across the village; 
third, they randomly selected an equal number of house- 
holds within each block and verbally administered the de- 
mographic and endorsement surveys, the latter of which 
was randomized to be either the control or one of the 
two treatment conditions.15 See SI Tables Al- A4 for 
evidence that random assignment was effectively imple- 
mented, and SI Appendix 2.3 for more information on 
data collection. Surveys were administered in 42 villages 
across eight counties and five of South Sudan's 10 states 
(see Figure 2). 16 
The dearth of reliable demographic data in South 
Sudan makes it difficult to make inferences about the 
representativeness of our sample (Caruso et al. 2017). In 
Table 3, we compare our overall and state-by-state sample 
characteristics with data from waves 1 (2015) and2 (2016) 
of the World Bank's High Frequency Survey. 1 7 Though the 
World Bank's survey was designed to be representative for 
all of South Sudan, four states were excluded for security 
reasons: Jonglei, Unity, Upper Nile, and Warrap. MRE 
teams were active and collected data for our study in 
three of these states (Unity, Upper Nile, and Warrap), 
highlighting the unique value of our data. 
We expect that our data will be skewed toward con- 
flict. Indeed, Unity and Upper Nile, and Warrap to a lesser

15We take the village as our lowest geographical unit, as blocks did not have defined boundaries. 
16 Fifteen Murle respondents are excluded from analysis due to their 
small sample size. Our final sample thus includes respondents from 
41 villages across seven counties and four states. 
17World Bank data from both surveys are available at http://micro 
data.worldbank.org. extent, fare much worse than Northern Bahr el Ghazal on 
a host of demographic characteristics, including exposure 
to violence and educational attainment. Our sample is a 
little older, perhaps due to greater displacement or deaths 
of younger civilians, and villages in our sample are almost 
entirely ethnically homogenous. The negative outgroup 
endorsement effect we identify may not generalize, at least 
as strongly, to less conflict-prone or to postconflict areas. 
See SI Table AIO for demographic summary statistics. 
In the supporting information, we report robustness to 
demographic controls (SI Appendix 8.1) and state fixed 
effects (SI Appendix 8.2). 
Results 
Citizens across ethnic groups are widely supportive of 
peace policies (see Figure 3 and SI Appendix 4.2). 
Nuer and Dinka Respondents 
We begin by restricting the sample to Dinka and Nuer re- 
spondents. First, we present point estimates of the mean 
levels of standardized indexed support for policies, with 
95% confidence intervals across treatment conditions, 
and split by respondent ethnicity (see Figure 4). 18 We 
report difference in means tests using the standard two- 
tailed t-test. We do not find evidence that an ingroup 
endorsement shifts support for Dinka ( ¡¿DinkaEndorser ~ 
'Lcontroi = 0.07, 95% confidence interval [-0.15, 0.30]) 
Or Nuer {¡¿Nuer Endorser P' control == 0.14, 95% confi- 
dence interval [-0.29, 0.01]) respondents. However, out- 
group endorsements result in substantively and statisti- 
cally significant decreases in support, of 1.21 standard 
deviations for Dinka respondents (95% confidence inter- 
val [-1.45, -0.98]) and 1.89 standard deviations for Nuer 
respondents (95% confidence interval [-2.04, -1.75]). 
These decreases exceed the standard "large" effect size 
of d = 0.8 (Lakens 2014). 
SI Appendix 7 reports Bayesian estimates and min- 
imum detectable effect sizes (MDEs) given our sample 
sizes. Our results indicate that the true effect of an in- 
group endorsement for Dinka respondents is zero. Results 
for Nuer respondents are mixed - we find some support 
for a true effect of zero, and some support for a negative 
effect - and thus we do not find the evidence sufficient to 
accept or reject the null hypothesis of no true effect. In 
sum, these results support the Outgroup Hypothesis but 
18 See SI Figure A 7 for the same figure with simple support averages.

not the Ingroup Hypothesis. We find evidence that out- 
group politician endorsements substantially reduce sup- 
port for peace policies. As regards ingroup endorsements, 
results either indicate no true effect (Dinka respondents) 
or insufficient evidence to reject the null of no true effect 
(Nuer respondents). 
Table 4 provides evidence that subjects' responses 
to leaders' endorsements are conditioned by their ethnicity.19 The fourth row (Dinka Endorser* Dinka 
Respondent) shows that an endorsement from a Dinka 
politician increases support among Dinka respondents, 
compared against Nuer respondents and relative to 
the control, 1.98 standard deviations (95% confidence 
interval [1.63, 2.33]). In contrast, the fifth row (Nuer

Figure 3 Distribution of Answers to Endorsement Questions 
Note : Row order corresponds to endorsement question number (1-6). 
Endorser* Dinka Respondent) shows that an endorse- 
ment from a Nuer politician decreases support among 
Dinka respondents, compared against Nuer respondents 
and relative to the control, 1.07 standard deviations (95% 
confidence interval [-1.44, -0.68]). Substituting average 
support for endorsement policies for the indexed support 
measure results in an estimated increase of 1.33 points 
(95% confidence interval [1.12, 1.53]) for the fourth row 
and a decrease of 0.71 points (95% confidence interval 
[-0.96, -0.45]) for the fifth row, on a 5-point scale. 
For comparison, Garbiras-Diaz, Garcia-Sanchez, and 
Matanock (2019) find that endorsements from favored 
politicians increase support for peace policies by 0.43 
and 0.88 points on a 7-point scale. Interaction effects 
are driven by decreases in support caused by outgroup 
endorsements (Table 5). The negative outgroup endorse- 
ment effect is consistent across all six policiesboth for Nuer 
and for Dinka respondents. Findings are robust to the 
inclusion of controls (SI Table A19) and state fixed effects 
(SI Table A21). 
Limited variation in Dinka and Nuer respondents' 
degrees of self-reported exposure to violence makes it dif- 
ficult to draw strong conclusions about the moderating 
effect of exposure to violence on outgroup leaders' en- 
dorsements. We present results in SI Appendix 3. 1 . We do 
not find any evidence of a moderating effect with Dinka 
respondents, and we find inconsistent evidence of a mod- 
erating effect using a proxy for exposure to violence that 
contains greater variation, whether one was displaced or 
not, with our Nuer subsample. Shilluk and Luo Respondents 
To further investigate the moderating effect of exposure 
to violence and to test the robustness of our findings, the 
experiment was expanded to include two minority eth- 
nic groups: the Shilluk and Luo. These groups can shed 
additional light on our findings because they have been 
exposed to violence from different combinations of eth- 
nic outgroups over the course of the civil war. Whereas 
the Shilluk in our sample had only recently faced extreme 
ethnically targeted violence exclusively at the hands of 
SPLM and Dinka-allied groups, the Luo have faced indis- 
criminate violence from both SPLM-IO and SPLM-allied 
forces.20 
Our Outgroup Hypothesis predicts that Shilluk re- 
spondents should, like Nuer respondents, respond neg- 
atively to Dinka endorsements of peace policies because 
exposure to violence from Dinka groups makes them trust 
Dinka leaders less and fear their possible exploitation of 
peace terms more. In contrast, because the Luo have faced 
indiscriminate violence from both sides, they should not 
fear one group more than the other. Our Outgroup Hy- 
pothesis would accordingly expect them to react similarly 
to Dinka and Nuer politician endorsements but does not 
offer a clear expectation as to whether endorsements will 
reduce or not change their support. 
20 See SI Appendix 2.4 for descriptions of each group's experience 
during the war.

Figure 4 Mean Standardized Indexed Support by Treatment and Respondent Ethnicity 
Figure 5 displays point estimates of the mean lev- 
els of standardized indexed support for policies with 
95% confidence intervals.21 We find evidence in favor 
of the Outgroup Hypothesis. A Dinka endorsement leads 
to a substantively important and statistically significant 
decrease in support for policies among Shilluk respon- 
dents of 1.34 standard deviations (95% confidence in- 
terval [-1.56, -1.11]). We do not find evidence that 
a Nuer endorsement shifts support either for Shilluk 
(M'Nwer Endors er l^confro/ == 0.16, 95% confidence in- 
terval [-0.35, 0.03]) Or Luo {[L^uer Endorser P-co«řro/ =:

nor that a Dinka endorsement shifts support for Luo re-

for Luo respondents. Evidence on the true effect of a Nuer 
politician endorsement on Shilluk respondents is incon- 
clusive. 
Discussion 
Interpretation of Ingroup Endorsement 
Effect 
We do not find any evidence of a positive ingroup en- 
dorsement effect for Nuer and Dinka respondents; to the 
contrary, our analysis in SI Appendix 7 suggests a true in- 
group endorsement effect of zero for Dinka respondents. 
We interpret the lack of an ingroup endorsement effect as 
being attributable to a decrease in the perceived compe- 
tence or shared interests of ingroup leaders due to years 
of prolonged conflict and failed peace deals. However, it

is possible that our null finding is instead attributable 
to ceiling effects or to citizens' greater familiarity with 
ingroup politicians' stances, which could make ingroup 
endorsements less informative. 
We think that these alternative explanations are un- 
likely. First, the raw average levels of support for policies 
in SI Figure A7 show that support has not reached a ceil- 
ing and there is still room for it to increase. In such a 
low-information environment, it is unlikely that respon- 
dents were very knowledgeable about the peace policies, 
let alone politicians' policy stances. Further, if differen- 
tial knowledge prior to the experiment was driving re- 
sults, we would expect that Shilluk and Luo respondents, 
who have no coethnic politician at the national level and 
thus should not have a high degree of knowledge about 
either politician's stances prior to the study, should be 
swayed either positively or negatively by both politicians' 
endorsements, which we do not observe. 
Interpretation of Outgroup Endorsement 
Effect 
In this section, we consider two alternative mechanisms 
for our negative outgroup endorsement effect findings. 
First, conflict could increase social polarization, leading individuals to update downward after an outgroup en- 
dorsement not because of security or trust ( instrumental) 
concerns but rather because of outgroup enmity. Schol- 
ars have found that identity-based differences can drive 
political behavior even where groups' issue-based differ- 
ences are moderate and ingroup candidates are unpop- 
ular (Abramowitz and Webster 2018; Iyengar and West- 
wood 2015). Distinguishing between instrumental and 
affect-based mechanisms has important normative im- 
plications: If people care only about which side wins, 
compromise is unlikely; further, the aim of using heuris- 
tics is not to act as if one was informed, undermining its 
central theorized benefit (Iyengar and Westwood 2015; 
Lupia 1994). 
Conflict is likely to increase social polarization, but 
we do not think it is the sole driver of our results. First, we 
would expect that Luo respondents who faced violence 
from both sides would respond negatively to endorse- 
ments from both Dinka and Nuer politicians. In contrast, 
individuals appear to respond negatively to endorsements 
only from outgroups that constitute a particular threat to 
their personal safety (e.g., when they are only targeted by 
that group for violence and not by the alternative group). 
Second, given the overwhelming desire for peace, we be- 
lieve that people will be instrumentally motivated to sup- 
port whichever policies they believe are most likely to

deliver peace. Third, while most studies on social polar- 
ization emphasize the role of outgroup enmity, they still 
anticipate and observe a positive ingroup effect and high 
ingroup loyalty, which we do not observe (Abramowitz 
and Webster 2018; Iyengar and Westwood 2015). Fourth, 
a factor analysis (SI Appendix 6) shows that the six en- 
dorsement questions load on two factors. Importantly, 
the two questions for which security concerns are likely 
to be most pressing, one on power-sharing and the sec- 
ond on joint control of security forces, most clearly load 
on one factor, whereas the remaining four endorsement 
questions most clearly define the other. Analysis is robust 
to using either factor as the dependent variable. 
A second alternative explanation of our results is that 
people respond negatively to endorsements from out- 
group leaders not due to security concerns, but because 
they fear that outgroup leaders will exclude them from 
government patronage. A factor analysis indicates that 
the endorsement question most likely to pick up on fear 
of capture of material benefits, on revisions to the national 
bank, does not load on a different factor than the others. 
We also added a question to the survey with Luo respon- dents to measure perceived ethnic bias in the distribution 
of public goods. We do observe that a Nuer endorsement 
increases support among Luo respondents who believe 
that leaders are ethnically biased by 0.44 standard devia- 
tions (95% confidence interval [0.26, 0.62] ).22 This effect 
appears to be driven primarily by an increase in support 
for the banking endorsement question. Results reported 
in this article are robust to excluding this question. 
Although we argue that security concerns play a key 
role in how individuals interpret endorsements, outgroup 
animus and material concerns may also explain some 
component of our observed effect. 
Focus Group Discussions with Dinka and 
Nuer Political Elites 
To better evaluate our understanding of the peace pro- 
cess in South Sudan, in November-December 2018 we 
conducted focus group discussions with Dinka (n = 7)

Figure 5 Mean Indexed Support Levels by Treatment and Respondent Ethnicity 
and Nuer (n = 10) political elites (see SI Figure A4 for 
questions). 
Our claims largely found support. Leaders and citi- 
zens appeared fearful of outgroup exploitation. A Nuer 
officer argued that past deals had broken down because 
"SPLM always wanted to dominate non-Dinkas and rule 
the government with Dinkas only." Nuer civilians were 
said to be "scared to trust the [SPLM] government in fill- 
filling the peace deal." Leaders insisted that their fears of 
the other side were not due to hate, but rather to a deep 
distrust.23 One Dinka village chief said, "We don't hate the 
opposition but they have to be more loyal and . . . fulfill 
their commitments as regards this peace deal." Both 
groups listed guaranteeing security among their top three 
priorities for achieving peace. 
23 Potentially consistent with this account are the high import civil- 
ians in the World Bank's High Frequency Survey attach to facilitat- 
ing healing between communities, ranking such efforts only behind 
an end to fighting as the best way to bring peace to South Sudan. Leaders described a low-information environment. 
They said that they only learned about peace deal provi- 
sions during briefings from leadership, a source of infor- 
mation unavailable to civilians. A SPLM-IO deputy com- 
mander observed that "some of the things [in the peace 
deal] are not understandable to [the people]." There was 
also evidence that some followers had grown weary of in- 
group leaders' promises, and a Dinka village chief noted, 
"This peace process is significant because South Sudanese 
citizens are tired with prolonged years of war." 
Focus group discussions, and accounts detailing how 
leaders on both sides in South Sudan were able to rely on 
critical support from coethnic communities even as they 
escalated violence and violated the peace deal, indicate 
that lower civilian support for peace deals might have 
consequential effects where civilians apply less pressure 
on ingroup elites and on communities to comply with 
settlement terms. A Nuer governor, the highest state-level 
public office, insisted that there was accountability: "If

civilians withdraw their support, then Kiir and Machar 
both will be out." Leaders stressed that civilians had "an 
equal role" in making the peace deal successful. A SPLM- 
IO military commander recalled instances where "people 
forced us to oblige with implementation of the agreements 
on time [and] improvement of security." A Dinka village 
chief stated that the key role of civilians was to "spread 
the positive message" of the peace deal by not engaging 
in intercommunal violence or cattle raiding, which could 
imperil on-the-ground settlement implementation. 
Conclusion 
We present results from a large-scale survey experiment 
conducted during a brief pause in civil war violence in 
South Sudan in 2016. We find that support for a tenta- 
tive peace deal drops precipitously when policies are en- 
dorsed by outgroup leaders, and suggestive evidence that 
negative effects are greatest for those whose communities 
were targeted most violently by that outgroup. Ingroup 
politician endorsements do not significantly alter indi- 
viduals' support for the peace settlement. We conclude 
that a policy from a distrusted outgroup leader conveys 
information - namely, that the leader sees a way to ex- 
ploit the policy - and makes individuals valuing security 
above all else less likely to support that policy. 
How can public support for peace settlements signed 
by leaders from warring groups be increased? Our study 
indicates that providing policy information may not be 
sufficient to overcome citizens' fears of outgroup leaders. 
Efforts to increase intergroup trust, to build and commu- 
nicate safeguards against outgroup exploitation, and to 
increase inclusion of civilians and, given recent evidence, 
in particular women in the peace process, may be more 
fruitful strategies for increasing public support.
