The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused global pandemic that ledto a dramatic loss of human life worldwide. Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenet-
ically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be
the possible primary reservoir. The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known,however, the rapid human to human transfer has been conﬁrmed widely. There is no clinically approvedantiviral drug or vaccine available to be used against COVID-19. However, few broad-spectrum antiviral
drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery. In the current
review, we summarize and comparatively analyze the emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infec-tion and previous human coronaviruses including severe ascute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-
CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We also discuss the approaches for
developing effective vaccines and therapeutic combinations to cope with this viral outbreak./C2112020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Cairo University. This is an open access article

Introduction
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family in the Nidovi-
rales order. Corona represents crown-like spikes on the outer sur-
face of the virus; thus, it was named as a coronavirus.

Coronaviruses are minute in size (65–125 nm in diameter) and
contain a single-stranded RNA as a nucleic material, size ranging
from 26 to 32kbs in length ( Fig. 1 ). The subgroups of coronaviruses
family are alpha ( a), beta ( b), gamma ( c) and delta ( d) coronavirus.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),
H5N1 inﬂuenza A, H1N1 2009 and Middle East respiratory syn-
drome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause acute lung injury (ALI) and
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which leads to pul-
monary failure and result in fatality. These viruses were thought
to infect only animals until the world witnessed a severe acute res-
piratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV, 2002 in
Guangdong, China [1]. Only a decade later, another pathogenic
coronavirus, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome coron-
avirus (MERS-CoV) caused an endemic in Middle Eastern countries
[2].
Recently at the end of 2019, Wuhan an emerging business hub
of China experienced an outbreak of a novel coronavirus that killed
more than eighteen hundred and infected over seventy thousand
individuals within the ﬁrst ﬁfty days of the epidemic. This virus
was reported to be a member of the bgroup of coronaviruses.
The novel virus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-
nCov) by the Chinese researchers. The International Committee
on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the virus as SARS-CoV-2
and the disease as COVID-19 [3–5] . In the history, SRAS-CoV
(2003) infected 8098 individuals with mortality rate of 9%, across
26 contries in the world, on the other hand, novel corona virus
(2019) infected 120,000 induviduals with mortality rate of 2.9%,
across 109 countries, till date of this writing. It shows that the
transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than SRAS-CoV and the
reason could be genetic recombination event at S protein in the
RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 may have enhanced its transmission
ability. In this review article, we discuss the transmission of human
coronaviruses brieﬂy. We further discuss the associated infectious-
ness and biological features of SARS and MERS with a special focus
on COVID-19.
Comparative analysis of emergence and spreading of
coronaviruses
In 2003, the Chinese population was infected with a virus caus-
ing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong pro-
vince. The virus was conﬁrmed as a member of the Beta-
coronavirus subgroup and was named SARS-CoV [6,7] . The infected
patients exhibited pneumonia symptoms with a diffused alveolar
injury which lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).SARS initially emerged in Guangdong, China and then spread
rapidly around the globe with more than 8000 infected personsand 776 deceases. A decade later in 2012, a couple of Saudi Arabian
nationals were diagnosed to be infected with another coronavirus.
The detected virus was conﬁrmed as a member of coronaviruses
and named as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(MERS-CoV). The World health organization reported that MERS-
coronavirus infected more than 2428 individuals and 838 deaths
[8]. MERS-CoV is a member beta-coronavirus subgroup and phylo-
genetically diverse from other human-CoV. The infection of MERS-
CoV initiates from a mild upper respiratory injury while progres-
sion leads to severe respiratory disease. Similar to SARS-
coronavirus, patients infected with MERS-coronavirus suffer pneu-
monia, followed by ARDS and renal failure [9].
Recently, by the end of 2019, WHO was informed by the Chi-
nese government about several cases of pneumonia with unfamil-
iar etiology. Although scientists suspected that Hunan seafoodmarket in Wuhan helped the virus spread, however, it was not
where the outbreak ﬁrst emerged [10]. On 12 January 2020, the
National Health Commission of China released further details
about the epidemic, suggested viral pneumonia [10]. From the
sequence-based analysis of isolates from the patients, the virus
was identiﬁed as a novel coronavirus. Moreover, the genetic
sequence was also provided for the diagnosis of viral infection. Ini-
tially, it was suggested that the patients infected with Wuhan coro-
navirus induced pneumonia in China may have visited the seafood
market where live animals were sold or may have used infected
animals or birds as a source of food. However, further investiga-
tions revealed that some individuals contracted the infection even
with no record of visiting the seafood market. These observations
indicated a human to the human spreading capability of this virus,
which was subsequently reported in more than 100 countries in
the world. The human to the human spreading of the virus occurs
due to close contact with an infected person, exposed to coughing,
sneezing, respiratory droplets or aerosols. These aerosols can pen-
etrate the human body (lungs) via inhalation through the nose or
mouth ( Fig. 2 )[11–14] .
Primary reservoirs and hosts of coronaviruses
The source of origination and transmission are important to be
determined in order to develop preventive strategies to contain the
infection. In the case of SARS-CoV, the researchers initially focused
on raccoon dogs and palm civets as a key reservoir of infection.However, only the samples isolated from the civets at the food
market showed positive results for viral RNA detection, suggesting
that the civet palm might be secondary hosts [15]. In 2001 the
samples were isolated from the healthy persons of Hongkong and
the molecular assessment showed 2.5% frequency rate of anti-bodies against SARS-coronavirus. These indications suggested that
SARS-coronavirus may be circulating in humans before causing the
outbreak in 2003 [16]. Later on, Rhinolophus bats were also found
to have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies suggesting the bats as a source of
viral replication [17]. The Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) coronavirus ﬁrst emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [9].
MERS-coronavirus also pertains to beta-coronavirus and having
camels as a zoonotic source or primary host [18]. In a recent study,
MERS-coronavirus was also detected in Pipistrellus and Perimyotis
bats [19], proffering that bats are the key host and transmitting
medium of the virus [20,21] . Initially, a group of researchers sug-
gested snakes be the possible host, however, after genomic similar-
ity ﬁndings of novel coronavirus with SARS-like bat viruses
supported the statement that not snakes but only bats could be
the key reservoirs ( Table 1 )[22,23] . Further analysis of homolo-
gous recombination revealed that receptor binding spike glycopro-
tein of novel coronavirus is developed from a SARS-CoV (CoVZXC21
or CoVZC45) and a yet unknown Beta-CoV [24]. Nonetheless, to
Fig. 1. Structure of respiratory syndrome causing human coronavirus.92 M.A. Shereen et al. / Journal of Advanced Research 24 (2020) 91–98eradicate the virus, more work is required to be done in the aspects
of the identiﬁcation of the intermediate zoonotic source that
caused the transmission of the virus to humans.
Key features and entry mechanism of human coronaviruses
All coronaviruses contain speciﬁc genes in ORF1 downstream
regions that encode proteins for viral replication, nucleocapsid
and spikes formation [25]. The glycoprotein spikes on the outer
surface of coronaviruses are responsible for the attachment and
entry of the virus to host cells ( Fig. 1 ). The receptor-binding
domain (RBD) is loosely attached among virus, therefore, the virus
may infect multiple hosts [26,27] . Other coronaviruses mostly rec-
ognize aminopeptidases or carbohydrates as a key receptor for
entry to human cells while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV recognize
exopeptidases [2]. The entry mechanism of a coronavirus depends
upon cellular proteases which include, human airway trypsin-like
protease (HAT), cathepsins and transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2) that split the spike protein and establish further pene-
tration changes [28,29] . MERS-coronavirus employs dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4), while HCoV-NL63 and SARS-coronavirus
require angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a key receptor
[2,26] .
SARS-CoV-2 possesses the typical coronavirus structure with
spike protein and also expressed other polyproteins, nucleopro-teins, and membrane proteins, such as RNA polymerase, 3-
chymotrypsin-like protease, papain-like protease, helicase, glyco-
protein, and accessory proteins [30,31] . The spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2 contains a 3-D structure in the RBD region to maintain
the van der Waals forces [32]. The 394 glutamine residue in the
RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 is recognized by the critical lysine 31
residue on the human ACE2 receptor [33]. The entire mechanism
of pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, from attachment to replication is
well mentioned in Fig. 3 .
Genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2
The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 has been reported over 80%
identical to the previous human coronavirus (SARS-like bat CoV)
[34]. The Structural proteins are encoded by the four structural
genes, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucle-
ocapsid (N) genes. The orf1ab is the largest gene in SARS-CoV-2
which encodes the pp1ab protein and 15 nsps. The orf1a gene
encodes for pp1a protein which also contains 10 nsps [34–36] .
According to the evolutionary tree, SARS-CoV-2 lies close to the
group of SARS-coronaviruses [37,38] (Fig. 5 ). Recent studies have
indicated notable variations in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 such
as the absence of 8a protein and ﬂuctuation in the number of
amino acids in 8b and 3c protein in SARS-CoV-2 [34] (Fig. 4 ). It is
also reported that Spike glycoprotein of the Wuhan coronavirus

of SARS-CoV-2 is the mixture of bat SARS-CoV and a not known
Beta-CoV [38]. In a ﬂuorescent study, it was conﬁrmed that the
SARS-CoV-2 also uses the same ACE2 (angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2) cell receptor and mechanism for the entry to host cell
which is previously used by the SARS-CoV [39,40] . The single
N501T mutation in SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein may have signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced its binding afﬁnity for ACE2 [33].
The major obstacle in research progress
Animal models play a vital role to uncover the mechanisms of
viral pathogenicity from the entrance to the transmission and
designing therapeutic strategies. Previously, to examine the repli-
cation of SARS-CoV, various animal models were used which
showed the symptoms of severe infection [43]. In contrast to
SARS-CoV, no MERS-CoV pathogenesis was observed in small ani-
mals. Mice are not vulnerable to infection by MERS-coronavirus
due to the non-compatibility of the DPP4 receptor [44]. As the
entire genome of the 2019-novel coronavirus is more than 80%
similar to the previous human SARS-like bat CoV, previously used
animal models for SARS-CoV can be utilized to study the infectious
pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The human ACE2 cell receptor is rec-
ognized by both SARS and Novel coronaviruses. Conclusively,
TALEN or CRISPR-mediated genetically modiﬁed hamsters or other
small animals can be utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of
novel coronaviruses. SARS-CoV has been reported to replicate and
cause severe disease in Rats (F344), where the sequence analysis
revealed a mutation at spike glycoprotein [45]. Thus, it could beanother suitable option to develop spike glycoprotein targeting
therapeutics against novel coronaviruses. Recently, mice models
and clinical isolates were used to develop any therapeutic strategy
against SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 [46,47] . In a similar study,
artiﬁcial intelligence prediction was used to investigate the inhibi-
tory role of the drug against SARS-CoV-2 [48]. SARS-CoV-2 infected
patients were also used to conduct randomized clinical trials
[46,49,50] . It is now important that the scientists worldwide col-
laborate the design a suitable model and investigate the in vivo
mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.
Potential therapeutic strategies against COVID-19
Initially, interferons- anebulization, broad-spectrum antibi-
otics, and anti-viral drugs were used to reduce the viral load
[49,51,52] , however, only remdesivir has shown promising impact
against the virus [53]. Remdesivir only and in combination with
chloroquine or interferon beta signiﬁcantly blocked the SARS-
CoV-2 replication and patients were declared as clinically recov-
ered [46,50,52] . Various other anti-virals are currently being eval-
uated against infection. Nafamostat, Nitazoxanide, Ribavirin,
Penciclovir, Favipiravir, Ritonavir, AAK1, Baricitinib, and Arbidol
exhibited moderate results when tested against infection in
patients and in-vitro clinical isolates [46,48,50,52] . Several other
combinations, such as combining the antiviral or antibiotics with
traditional Chinese medicines were also evaluated against SARS-
CoV-2 induced infection in humans and mice [46]. Recently in
Shanghai, doctors isolated the blood plasma from clinically recov-
ered patients of COVID-19 and injected it in the infected patients

the S protein facilitates viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane through the endosomal pathway. Then SARS-CoV-2 releases RNA into the host cell . Genome RNA is
translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small products by viral proteinases. The polymerase produces a series of subgenomic
mRNAs by discontinuous transcription and ﬁnally translated into relevant viral proteins. Viral proteins and genome RNA are subsequently assembled into virions in the ER
and Golgi and then transported via vesicles and released out of the cell. ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, E R–Golgi intermediate

study, it was identiﬁed that monoclonal antibody (CR3022) binds -
with the spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2. This is likely due to the anti-
body’s epitope not overlapping with the divergent ACE2receptor-binding motif. CR3022 has the potential to be developed
as a therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other
neutralizing antibodies for the prevention and treatment of -
COVID-19 infection [55].

There is no available vaccine against COVID-19, while previous
vaccines or strategies used to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV
can be effective. Recombinant protein from the Urbani (AY278741)
strain of SARS-CoV was administered to mice and hamsters,
resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies and protec-
tion against SARS-CoV [56,57] . The DNA fragment, inactivated
whole virus or live-vectored strain of SARS-CoV (AY278741), sig-
niﬁcantly reduced the viral infection in various animal models
[58–63] . Different other strains of SARS-CoV were also used to pro-
duce inactivated or live-vectored vaccines which efﬁciently
reduced the viral load in animal models. These strains include,
Tor2 (AY274119) [64,65] , Utah (AY714217) [66], FRA (AY310120)
[59], HKU-39849 (AY278491) [57,67] , BJ01 (AY278488) [68,69] ,
NS1 (AY508724) [70], ZJ01 (AY297028) [70], GD01 (AY278489)
[69] and GZ50 (AY304495) [71]. However, there are few vaccines
in the pipeline against SARS-CoV-2. The mRNA based vaccine pre-
pared by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dis-
eases against SARS-CoV-2 is under phase 1 trial [72]. INO-4800-
DNA based vaccine will be soon available for human testing [73].
Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) working
on the development of an inactivated virus vaccine [74,75] . Soon
mRNA based vaccine’s sample (prepared by Stermirna Therapeu-
tics) will be available [76]. GeoVax-BravoVax is working to develop
a Modiﬁed Vaccina Ankara (MVA) based vaccine [77]. While Clover
Biopharmaceuticals is developing a recombinant 2019-nCoV S pro-
tein subunit-trimer based vaccine [78].
Although research teams all over the world are working to
investigate the key features, pathogenesis and treatment options,
it is deemed necessary to focus on competitive therapeutic options
and cross-resistance of other vaccines. For instance, there is a pos-
sibility that vaccines for other diseases such as rubella or measles
can create cross-resistance for SARS-CoV-2. This statement of
cross-resistance is based on the observations that children in china
were found less vulnerable to infection as compared to the elder
population, while children are being largely vaccinated for measles
in China.
Conclusion and perspective
Scientists are still investigating the emergence and origination
of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, its zoonotic source of transmission to
humans has not been conﬁrmed yet, however, sequence-based
analysis suggested bats as the key reservoir. DNA recombination
was found to be involved at spike glycoprotein which assorted
SARS-CoV (CoVZXC21 or CoVZC45) with the RBD of another BetaCoV, thus could be the reason for cross-species transmission and
rapid infection. According to phylogenetic trees, SARS-CoV is closer
to SARS-like bat CoVs. Until now, no promising clinical treatments
or prevention strategies have been developed against human coro-
naviruses. However, the researchers are working to develop efﬁ-
cient therapeutic strategies to cope with the novel coronaviruses.
Various broad-spectrum antivirals previously used against inﬂuen-
za, SARS and MERS coronaviruses have been evaluated either alone
or in combinations to treat COVID-19 patients, mice models, and
clinical isolates. Remdesivir, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Oseltamivir
signiﬁcantly blocked the COVID-19 infection in infected patients.
It can be cocluded that the homologus recombination event at the
S protein of RBD region enhanced the transmission ability of the
virus. While the decision of bring back the nationals from infected
area by various countries and poor screening of passengers, become
the leading cause of spreading virus in others countries.
Most importantly, human coronaviruses targeting vaccines and
antiviral drugs should be designed that could be used against thecurrent as well as future epidemics. There are many companies
working for the development of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,
such as Moderna Therapeutics, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Novavax,
Vir Biotechnology, Stermirna Therapeutics, Johnson & Johnson,
VIDO-InterVac, GeoVax-BravoVax, Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Cur-
eVac, and Codagenix. But there is a need for rapid human and
animal-based trails as these vaccines still require 3–10 months
for commercialization. There must be a complete ban on utilizing
wild animals and birds as a source of food. Beside the development
of most efﬁcient drug, a strategy to rapidly diagnose SARS-CoV-2 insuspected patient is also required. The signs and symptoms of
SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 are a bit similar to inﬂuenza and
seasonal allergies (pollen allergies). Person suffering from inﬂu-
enza or seasonal allergy may also exhibit temprature which can
be detected by thermo-scanners, hence the person will becomesuspected. Therefore, an accurate and rapid diagnostic kit or meter
for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients is required, as
the PCR based testing is expensive and time consuming. It is appre-
ciable that the Chinese health workers have efﬁciently controlled
the outbreak in china and limited the mortality rate to less than
3% only. The therapeutic strategies used by Chinese healthcare
authorities, should also be followed by other countries.
