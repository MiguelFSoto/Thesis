in geometry a square is a twodimensional plane figure with four equal sides and all the four angles are equal to ninety degrees the properties of rectangle are somewhat similar to a square but the difference between the two is a rectangle has only its opposite sides equal therefore a rectangle is called a square only if all its four sides are of equal length a square is a twodimensional closed shape with equal sides and vertices its opposite sides are parallel to each other we can also think of a square as a rectangle with equal length and breadth a flat shape with four sides of equal length and four angles of ninety degrees a square is a figure with four equal sides and four right angles a plane rectangle with four equal sides and four right angles a foursided regular polygon a square is a shape with four sides that are all the same length and four corners that are all right angles a flat shape with straight sides where all sides have equal length and every interior angle is a right angle ninety degrees a square is a closed twodimensional shape d shape with four sides all four sides of a square are equal and parallel to each other in euclidean geometry a square is a regular quadrilateral which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles ninety degree angles pi radian angles or right angles it can also be defined as a rectangle with two equal length adjacent sides it is the only regular polygon whose internal angle central angle and external angle are all equal ninety degrees and whose diagonals are all equal in length a foursided shape that is made up of four straight sides that are the same length and that has four right angles in geometry a plane figure with four equal sides and four right ninety degrees angles a square is a special kind of rectangle an equilateral one and a special kind of parallelogram an equilateral and equiangular one a square has four axes of symmetry and its two finite diagonals as with any rectangle are equal bisection of a square by a diagonal results in two right triangles if the length of the side of a square is s then the area of the square is s or s squared from this relation is derived the algebraic use of the term square which denotes the product that results from multiplying any algebraic expression by itself a square is a foursided figure whose sides are all the same length and whose angles are all right angles measuring ninety degrees to be a square a shape must be all these things a plane figure a closed shape a regular polygon a quadrilateral in geometry a square is a twodimensional twodimensional figure with four equal sides and every one the four angles are adequate to ninety degrees the properties of a rectangle are somewhat similar to a square but the difference between the two is a rectangle has only its opposite sides equal therefore a rectangle can be said to be a square as long as all its four sides are of equal length a square is a quadrilateral with four equal sides there are numerous items around us that are square in shape each square shape is distinguished by its equal sides and inner angles that are equal to ninety degrees a square is a closed twodimensional d form having four sides it has four equal and parallel sides a square is a rectangle with equal length adjacent sides this indicates that it is a quadrilateral with equal twlength sides every angle in a square is a right angle a square is a closed twodimensional quadrilateral that is made up of two pairs of parallel lines all four sides of a square are equal and opposite sides of a square are parallel to each other and the interior angles of a square are equal to ninety degrees a square is a type of parallelogram in which the adjacent sides are equal and the measure of angles is ninety in other words a square is a closed twodimensional shape d shape with all four sides equal a square is a flat shape with four straight sides such that all the sides have the same length and all adjacent sides are perpendicular to each other all interior angles are right angles it is a type of quadrilateral a regular polygon and is closely related to the class of parallelograms especially the rhombus it is a geometric shape having four equal line segments that intersect at four points to create four internal angles of ninety degrees each a square is a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles opposite sides that are parallel two diagonals that bisect at right angles and four lines of symmetry a square is the only regular quadrilateral
